Challenge 22
Make an HTML file with a paragraph and a
button. When you click the button, make the
paragraph turn green.
For now put <script> tags at the bottom of the
page, before the closing </body> tag.

Challenge 23
Add a few more paragraphs. When
you click the button, all the
paragraphs turn green.

Challenge 24
Change the HTML so that there is a
div around one paragraph. Make it
so that when you click the button a
new paragraph is added to the div,
with the text, "A new paragraph" in
it.
You may need to go back to the
slides on changing the DOM to see
how to do this.

Challenge 25
For this challenge, add an
additional button that removes the
last paragraph from the div.

Challenge 26
For this challenge, change the first
paragraph so that it says, "This is
paragraph number 1".
Each time the user presses the add
paragraph button, the number at
the end of the statement
increments.
When the user clicks the remove
paragraph button, it functions as
normal, but alerts the user if they
try to delete the last paragraph.

Challenge 27
Add a form. When the user submits
a number, change the size of the
font for the h1 to be equal to the
number they submitted in pixels.
If no number is entered, or
something other than a number is
entered, alert that the user must
enter a number.
To make this work you will have to
prevent the default behavior for
the form submission.

Challenge 28
For this challenge, create the HTML
and CSS on the right. Then write a
script that when you hover the
mouse over the div, it adds the
class "big".
Write a second event handler for
when the mouse goes off the div, it
removes the class "big".

Challenge 29 Markup
Create the HTML & CSS as
shown.
Write a script that changes
the class on the body tag
for each 500 pixels the user
scrolls. At 500px down the
page the body gets class
two, and at 1000 it gets
class three, etc.
You can use if/else
statements, but try using a
switch statement!


Challenge 30
Change the HTML and CSS
to this, then write a script
that changes the class on
the body tag based on the
key that was pressed.
If someone presses a
different key, give them a
nasty alert message.
Use the switch statement
again.
